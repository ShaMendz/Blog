    <h3>Status Update 1</h3>
    <p>Honestly, progress on web developing is kind of slow. It'd just be easier to make a website on WordPress or Wix than from scratch but I feel like I can't really grasp a lot of things through that approach.

        It's a steady stream of improvement. Not too fast and not too slow. I only every start programming when it's night time so no one interrrupts my flow. If I lose the rhythm I just lose focus and start scrolling through<br>

        Twitter or Reddit. I only ever get in 2 hours of learning with this approach but it's actually quite effective. I use most of my day to do chores, some school work and somedays hang out with my bros, but at night just do<br>

        art and this. It's my little bubble of alone time and the time where i get most productive. Anyways, I've learned a little bit about Javascript (buttons and stuff) and how to kind of stylize the webpage a little. 
        <br>

        I'm running out of ideas to add to the pages but that's fine. I'll make something up along the way. This is a pretty interesting job and I'll be pursuing it further. Hopefully it gets me somewhere!</p>
